## Me

Hi, I'm Itai Nathaniel. I'm doing PHP for ~25 years now, and Laravel for ~10 years.

## The Project

I ran it with Larael Valet, but then remembered I can't trust you have it so I used these two commands to run the project:

```
php artisan serve --host=meckano.test
npm run dev
```

It should run on port 8000. You can then go to the URL http://meckano.test:8000. You'll have to [register first](http://meckano.test:8000/register)
